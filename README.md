Install Docker Compose

Installation Steps
1. Download Docker Compose
The preferred method to install Docker Compose is to download the binary from the official Docker GitHub repository. You can use the following command to download the latest stable release:

bash
Copy code
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -

Clone this repository in a new folder

Build and Run all containers with docker.compose build and docker-compose up

It ain't much, but is honest work
